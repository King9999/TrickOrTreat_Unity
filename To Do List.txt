TO DO LIST FOR TRICK OR TREAT
---------------------------
-Witch's magic shot does not interact with the house. Will try adding collision check in house script. *FIXED*
-Randomize which houses get candy so that there aren't scenarios where a house never gets candy *FIXED*
-Add AI opponents
-Add netplay via PUN (not sure if I will do this)
-Add UI for each player, including cooldown for tricks.
-Prevent candy from continuously being taken from house even when player is away from it. *FIXED*
-Figure out how to get at least two gamepads to work
